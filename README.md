# Project Title: Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Machine Learning project! In this final module, we'll delve into machine learning (ML), a powerful subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. At a high-level, ML can be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. For this project, we'll focus on supervised learning, specifically simple linear regression.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll:

1. **Build a Model:** We'll start by building a simple linear regression model. This involves preparing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, and training the model using the training data.

2. **Make Predictions:** Once the model is trained, we'll use it to make predictions on the testing data. We'll evaluate the performance of the model by comparing its predictions with the actual values in the testing set.

3. **Visualize the Model:** We'll visualize the linear regression model by plotting the best-fit line along with the actual data points from the testing set. This visualization will help us understand how well the model fits the data.

4. **Publish Your Insights:** Finally, we'll summarize our findings and insights from the project. We'll discuss the implications of the model's performance and potential applications in real-world scenarios.

# Card Class Documentation

## Overview
The Card class represents a playing card with attributes for face value and suit.

## Class: Card
Represents a playing card.

## Attributes
face: The face value of the card (e.g., "Ace", "King", "Queen", etc.).
suit: The suit of the card (e.g., "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades").

## Methods
__init__(face, suit): Initializes a new Card object with the provided face value and suit.
face: Returns the face value of the card.
suit: Returns the suit of the card.
image_name: Returns the filename of the image associated with the card.

## Example Usage

# Create a Card instance
card = Card('Ace', 'Hearts')

# Get card attributes
print(card.face)  # Output: Ace
print(card.suit)  # Output: Hearts

# Get the image filename associated with the card
print(card.image_name)  # Output: Ace_of_Hearts.png

# Confusion Matrix Visualization

This repository contains code for visualizing a confusion matrix using Python libraries such as pandas and seaborn.

# Introduction
A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm.

# Usage
## Prerequisites
You also need to install the following libraries:

pandas
seaborn
matplotlib

# Input
The input to the script is a confusion matrix, which is a 2D array representing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each class in a classification problem.

# Output
The script generates a heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix using the seaborn library.
